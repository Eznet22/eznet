# EZnet
Easy Deployment Wireless Network Solution for Events

1) Purpose
EZnet has begun as an idea for scout festivals, where is easy deployment, easy setup, but also high availability and scalability needs.
It consists of solid networking backbone, where is considered Wireless Mesh as the best solution, customised Mikrotik hardware, which can be used both indoors and outdoors, simple "customer" administration interface, and special diagnostic and remote access features.

2) Network Backbone
It is basically a configuration for Mikrotik RouterOS, based on WDS and/or Nstreme technologies, originally designed for RB912x boards.
Two wireless interfaces are being used, 2.4 GHz for the backbone MESH, and the second, 5 GHz, for client access.
No wired interfaces are used on the APs, only the main box with 5G connectivity has some wired interconnections. It also maintains monitoring, and most security functions.

3) Resilience
All APs have custom boxes and are designed for part-time outdoor use. All are also hot-swappable, no need to configure them per event.

4) UI
